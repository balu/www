Welcome to computational complexity theory.

* Learning Outcomes

[[file:../../data/cct/lo.pdf][The learning outcomes for the course]].

* Evaluation

There will be four written exams — A, B, Midsem (M), and Endsem
(E). Each will contribute 25%. The performances in exams will only be
considered up to a cut-off grade.

For higher grades than the written exam cut-off grade, a student has
to do take-home written assignments that will test advanced problem
solving skills. These will only be considered if the performance in
written exams is good. If I feel that further evaluation is necessary,
then I may conduct a viva too. Final grade may be revised upward or
downward depending on the performance in viva.
